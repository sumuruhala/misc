[Program 1] A simple compile-time calculator leveraging C++ Template Meta-Programming mechanism.
-Related Files: calc_tmp.cpp, cadriv.py, cadriv.bat.
-Description: calc_tmp.cpp parses and calculates simple arithmetic expression, e.g. "(1+2)*(3-4)/5%6+(1!-((2^3)^4))/2!!".
All of the calculation is done in C++ COMPILE-time. "cadriv" stands for "CAlculator DRIVer", which is responsible for driving the C++ file/compiler to do the job as well as for handling the results. Input is accepted in a file named "calc_tmp_expr_in.txt", and the result is output in the same file.

[Program 2] A simple console calculator implemented in C++11 and Erlang, respectively.
-Related Files: calc.cpp, calc2.erl.
